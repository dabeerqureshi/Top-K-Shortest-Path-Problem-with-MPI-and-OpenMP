# Top-K-Shortest-Path-Problem-with-MPI-and-OpenMP
In this project students will tackle the K Shortest Path Problem using a combination of MPI for distributed computing and OpenMP for shared memory parallelization within MPI processes. The goal is to find the Kth shortest path among all nodes of a given graph.
